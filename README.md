### CsuChhs.Imaging

This library is a wrapper for calls to the image processor library (https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor )

The CHHS Imaging library uses ImageSharp behind the scenes to make thumbnails of image streams.Â  You can use CHHS.Common.Imaging.API resizing class to do this.
